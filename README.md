# Anti-AFK

Anti-AFK is a handy application designed to keep your in-game character active by simulating keyboard strokes. It is particularly useful for preventing inactivity timeouts in games like Roblox and various applications. The application comes with a user-friendly interface and allows you to customize the frequency of keyboard inputs to suit your needs.
